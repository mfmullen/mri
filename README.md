# mri
Tools for MRI I have used for research. Currently only have GRAPPA and dual polarity distortion correction ported from MATLAB. Do the file size constraints, the multi-channel receive data for grappa which was used to test the implementation is a reduced spatial resolution. For the same reason, the data for dual polarity encoding has already been RSOS'd over coils.
